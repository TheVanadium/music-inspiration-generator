Inspired by Ryan Leach (https://youtu.be/snFkiR6RT3s)

## Usage

Click the "Generate new motif" button, and 3-4 quarter notes (number depends on time signature) are randomly generated with a suggested speed, time signature, and key signature.

The first note will always be the tonic, and the highest note will be no larger than a ninth away from said tonic.

## Installation

You will need to install vexflow in addition to the usual node modules:

`npm install vexflow`
